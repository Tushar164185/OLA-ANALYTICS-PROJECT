# OLA-ANALYTICS-PROJECT
Analyzed OLA ride-hailing cancellations caused by “driver not found.” Created BRD, studied booking data with SQL and dashboards in Power BI, identified demand-supply gaps, and recommended solutions like driver incentives and predictive allocation to reduce cancellations and improve customer experience.
